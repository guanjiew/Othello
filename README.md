Othello is a 2-player board game that is played with distinct pieces that are typically black on one side and white on the other side, each side belonging to one player. Our version of the game is played on a chess board of any size, but the typical game is played on an 8x8 board. Players (black and white) take turns placing their pieces on the board. Placement is dictated by the rules of the game, and can result in the flipping of coloured pieces from white to black or black to white. The rules of the game are explained in detail at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi (Links to an external site.).
Objective: The player’s goal is to have a majority of their coloured pieces showing at the end of the game.
